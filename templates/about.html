            <p>Hello, I'm <b>Amitesh Jha</b>, a B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science Engineering at CCSIT, TMU, and a passionate educator with a strong inclination toward technology and innovation.</p>
                <p>As a dedicated online educator, I have successfully taught Physics to CBSE students up to Class 12 for five years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring quality education even during challenging times. My YouTube channel, <b>Educaation Arena</b>, has become a trusted resource for students, featuring tutorials on Python, Data Structures, and foundational computer science topics.</p>
                <p><b>Key Achievements and Projects:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>I Reserve - Seat Booking App:</b> Developed a Flask-based seat booking system with features like wing selection, time slots, and email/SMS notifications, providing a seamless booking experience.</li>
                    <li><b>Python Tutorials:</b> Created comprehensive series on NumPy, Flask, and Tkinter to help students build real-world projects.</li>
                    <li><b>Research Publication:</b> Successfully published a research paper titled "Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0: A Comparative Analysis," contributing to the understanding of emerging web technologies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Beyond academics, I have consistently focused on self-improvement and growth, completing a rigorous course in C++ and Data Structures from Coding Ninjas, where I solved 100 questions in just 21 days. I am also involved in creating responsive portfolios and user-friendly web applications.</p>
                <p>Join me on this journey to explore the endless possibilities of technology and education. Together, let's innovate, learn, and create a better future!</p>
